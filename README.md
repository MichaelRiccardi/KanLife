# KanLife

Personal task board inspired by kanban that interfaces with Trello and Google Calendar. It is currently in working condition for my specific use cases, with a Google Script syncing the scheduled cards to my calendar. I hope to eventually integrate with the official Google Calendar API directly and publish instructions on how others can use and customize this for themselves.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
